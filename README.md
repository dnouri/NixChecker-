# ðŸ’»ðŸ‘¾ [python/emacs/llm] NixChecker an online twitter fact checker bot

## Abstract

We'll create a fact checking bot.  It will be able to respond
automatically on Twitter to requests for fact checking a newspaper
article that you send it.

The fact check will include a brief text of a summary and the facts
presented in the article.  It will then continue to assess the main
points in the article to the best of its ability, using a score.

## Installation

Create a virtual environment to get started:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Remember to activate the environment whenever you start a new
terminal, or you get back to the project.

You can also install project dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
python extract-article.py \
    "https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20240918-federal-reserve-lowers-us-interest-rates-weeks-before-us-election"
```

You can use the llm CLI tool to summarise the article offline like so:

```bash
pip install llm
python extract-article.py https://magit.vc/ | \
    llm -m Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct -s "Summarise this article and include why it's a great tool"
```
