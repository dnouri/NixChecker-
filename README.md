# ðŸ’»ðŸ‘¾ [python/emacs/llm] NixChecker an online twitter fact checker bot ðŸ§ ðŸ“Š

## Abstract

We'll create a fact checking bot.  It will be able to respond
automatically on Twitter to requests for fact checking a newspaper
article that you send it.

The fact check will include a brief text of a summary and the facts
presented in the article.  It will then continue to assess the main
points in the article to the best of its ability, using a score.
